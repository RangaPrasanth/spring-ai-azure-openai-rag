Spring AI - Azure OpenAI RAG Example 🚀
This repository contains an Azure OpenAI-powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) example built with Spring Boot and Spring AI. It demonstrates how to integrate LLMs (Large Language Models) with a retrieval mechanism to enhance response accuracy by fetching relevant context dynamically.

Features 🌟
✅ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with OpenAI API
✅ Spring Boot integration for AI-driven workflows
✅ Vector search for context-aware responses
✅ Embeddings & knowledge base management
✅ API-driven architecture for seamless integration

Tech Stack 🛠️
🔹 Spring Boot 3.x | Spring AI | OpenAI API
🔹 PostgreSQL / MySQL (for knowledge base storage)
🔹 PostgreSQL Vector DB
🔹 Docker (for containerization)

Usage 🚀
1️⃣ Clone the repo
2️⃣ Configure Azure OpenAI API key & database
3️⃣ Run the Spring Boot application
4️⃣ Test the RAG-powered AI responses
